Purpose:
	To create a simple ray tracer to render a scene composed of two spheres. The two spheres are of dierent radii and colors. For simplicity, I am assuming a directional light and a parallel view for rendering purposes. Meaning that a single LookAt vector can be used to generate all rays.

This is a homework assignment I did for my Computer Graphics course. We had to implement our own ray tracer. Even though I am importing OpenGL and Glut, I only used them to display my buffer. All the actual raytracing calculations were done by me.
